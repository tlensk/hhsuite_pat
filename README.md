# PAT HMM similarity analysis via HH-suite
## Tatiana Lenskaia, t.lenskaia@utoronto.ca

This repository contains a library of Python 3 scripts developed for exploring HMM similarity.
The calculations of the similarity metrics are done using with the help of several tools available in HH-suite3.
The developed scripts are separated into the following three groups: (1) pre-processing scripts; (2) auxiliary scripts; (3) scripts for analyzing outputs.
More details are available in the Scripts sub-directory.
